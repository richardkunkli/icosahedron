# Project Icosahedron
This project is a sample work.

## Technologies
- React, Next.js
- React Three Fiber (Three.js)

## What is it?
This is a 3D rendered icosahedron that has 12 vertices and 20 faces. Each click on it's surface increases the grays on the material by 10% from 0% to 100%. After the 11th click the spherical triangles divide into 4 equilateral, spherical triangles and the process starts again until it reaches level 19. At the end, it will become red. It visualizes well that after each division it approximates better an sphere.
