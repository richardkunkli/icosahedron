# Project Icosahedron
This project is a sample work.

## Technologies
- React, NextJS
- React Three Fiber (Three.js)

## What is it?
This is a 3D rendered icosahedron with 12 vertices. Each click on it's surface increases the grays on the material by 10% from 0% to 100%. After the 11th click the spherical triangles divide into 4 equal spherical triangles and the process starts again until it reaches level 19. At the end, it will become red. It visualizes well that after each division it approximates an sphere object.
